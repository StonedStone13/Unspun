# Unspun

**Politics without performance**

Welcome to Unspun — a platform for truth-telling, care-centered politics, and collective resistance. We reject attack-based discourse and empty gestures. Instead, we create space for genuine conversations about real issues, grounded in lived experience and hopeful resistance.

Our symbol is the open hand — a gesture of care, honesty, and solidarity. Our tone is earthy, grounded, and unapologetic.

Explore our values, issues, and resources as we build together.
