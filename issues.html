        <h2>Politics without performance</h2>

    <main>
        <section>
            <h2>Humanitarian Missions</h2>
            <p>Borders shouldn’t decide who gets to live. We believe in global solidarity—mutual aid, refugee support, disaster response, and dignity for all. Human lives aren’t bargaining chips. We show up where systems fail, not to save—but to stand beside.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Combatting Misinformation</h2>
            <p>Truth is under siege. We fight propaganda, corporate spin, and algorithmic manipulation. Education, transparency, and media literacy are our weapons. We don’t just fact-check—we truth-build.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Climate Justice</h2>
            <p>This isn’t just about carbon—it’s about colonization, extraction, and survival. We center Indigenous leadership, frontline communities, and ecological repair. No more delay. No more greenwashing. We fight for the land, the water, and each other.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Labor & Economy</h2>
            <p>Work should nourish, not deplete. We support unions, worker co-ops, and guaranteed income. We reject exploitation disguised as opportunity. The economy must serve people—not profit margins.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Healthcare</h2>
            <p>Care is sacred. Healthcare must be free, accessible, and rooted in community. We uplift care workers, dismantle medical gatekeeping, and fight for systems that heal—not harm. Health is a right, not a privilege.</p>
